# Neural Networks in a Nutshell

## Installation Notes
This tutorial requires *jupyter, *tensorflow* and *keras*. These can be installed with *pip* by typing the following in Terminal:

    pip install jupyterlab tensorflow keras pandas sklearn

We will be reviewing the materials with Jupyter notebooks. You should be able to type

    jupyter-lab

in your terminal window and see the notebook panel load in your web browser.


## Presentation Format

This tutorial is designed to get the audience training neural networks at the end of a 1-hour session. In particular, it covers areas where neural networks really shines - CNNs and RNNs. These techniques are applied on the Kaggle Titanic, MNIST and Rotten Tomatoes datasets.
